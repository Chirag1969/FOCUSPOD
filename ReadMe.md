## 1. Description of the project
FocusPod is a simple productivity app that consists of two main features:
* Pomodoro Timer 
* To do / Task List

"__What was the reason behind the development of such a application?"

I was inspired by web applications such as but not limited to: 
* [Hours](https://hours.zone/)
* [Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.team/)
* [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/)

As well as also building my skills such as: 
* U.I design
